        Everything I have learned about HTML and CSS at this point has been from the class lectures and videos.
        Examples of things I have learned from HTML are ways to organize information on a webpage. Not only does this 
        help for readability, but it also helps individuals suffering from blindess or other conditions that require
        screen readers. For instance, I am labeling the titles, headings, and paragraphs correctly instead of just writing
        a bunch of information in the body.

        I have also learned a lot about CSS and adding style to my webpages. The subject I have developed the most interest 
        for is flex boxes. They seem to have the most modern use and can help you create a variety of website designs. In this 
        webpage, I have created an internal stylesheet that utilizes a lot of the things I have learned. For example, in this 
        webpage, I change font style, color and add shadowing. On top of that, I have all of the data in a flex box to make it
        look nice and allow me to easily edit alignment. While all of this stuff is just the basics, I feel that I have a
        strong foundation and can utilize these basics to correctly implement more complex features. BTW I ran this through
        the html validator, which I've gotten into the habit of doing :)
