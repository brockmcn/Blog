    <h1>Blog 7</h1>
    <p>
        The majority of my time for this blog was put into deploying a react app to my blog server. This was difficult
        because I had to figure a lot of it out on my own, only using the twodee videos as reference. Because of that, I
        did minimal actual react programming (I plan to do more next week), but I created the base for a calculator
        application. Currently I have a basic calculator layout set up in react with css. In my App.js file, I use
        "&lt;Calculator /&gt;" to call my calculator.js file, all using React. Next, I need to add
        functionality usinng React. The link "React App" below will take you to my react deployment page, and the link
        next to that "React Calculator" is
        a resource I am using on how to create a simple calculator using React.
