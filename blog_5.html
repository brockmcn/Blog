    <h1>Blog 5</h1>

    <p>A cool thing I learned today that I found while looking into my project is placeholders for input text. A lot of
        nice websites use placeholders in input areas instead of using labels (or they use lables to look like
        placeholders). Below is an example of a text input with a placeholder that disappears when the input text
        is being type in. I accomplish this by adding a placeholder tag to the input and access the placeholder by using
        ::placeholder.
    </p>
    <a href="">Input with Placeholder</a>
    <div class="box">
        <input type="text" placeholder="Name">
    </div>

    <p>
        However, using a placeholder did not satisfy what I needed for my project. I needed the placeholder to display
        above the input area once selected, but placeholders stay inside the input. To fix this, I replaced placeholder
        with a label and positioned the label inside of the input. A challenge I then ran into was accessing the label's
        attributes on the input's focus. This is where I learned a neat trick in css in order to accomplish that. You
        can add a '+ class/id/element' after another element. So for my project, I used 'input:focus + label'. Below is
        also an example of me changing the label position on input focus. The only downside is (another challenge I
        figured
        out) that the label needs to come after the input in the html.

    <a href="">Input Label Movement</a>
    <div class="box">
        <input type="text">
        <label>Name</label>
    </div>
</body>
