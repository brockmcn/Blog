            For this week, I looked into embedding elements. The first type of elements I looked into embedding were
            YouTube videos. This was pretty easy since YouTube basically includes the HTML code for you automatically.
            Below is an embedded video I referenced on how to embed YouTube videos using HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <iframe width="966" height="543" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YffrCViTVk" frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
            allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <p>
            Along with embedding YouTube videos, I also looked into how to embed social media stuff. Below is the video
            I used as reference for embedding social media links. I practiced by embedding a facebook link, which is also done
            below. Facebook was a little more difficult bcause it required me to include a Javascript SDK, but it's working!
